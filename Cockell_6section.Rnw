\section{Summary}

Bioconductor provides us with all the tools we need to go from raw data in a
public repository to deriving novel conclusions about the function of groups of
genes, via data quality control and detection of differentially expressed genes.
We have only scratched the surface of the 671 packages available (at time of
writing, see \url{http://bioconductor.org} for an up-to-date list). Import and
processing of Affymetrix microarrays is provided by the \texttt{affy}\cite{affy}
and \texttt{simpleaffy} packages\cite{Wilson15092005}. Other methods of
differential expression analysis are available, in packages such as
\texttt{RankProd}\cite{Hong15112006}. Batch effects, systematic errors that can
cause many problems with microarray analysis, can be dealt with using the
methods available in the \texttt{sva} package\cite{Leek17012012}, especially
\texttt{ComBat}\cite{Johnson01012007}. Bioconductor also doesn't just provide
packages for analysing expression microarrays, there is also extensive support
for different types of arrays, such as methylation arrays, arrayCGH, SNP arrays
etc. Beyond microarrays, there are also many packages for the analysis of
proteomics data and latterly next-generation sequencing analysis. Coupled with
generic packages for inferring biological meaning, and visualising large and
complex datasets, Bioconductor is increasingly a `one-stop' solution for many
bioinformatics analyses.
