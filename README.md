==========================================

This repository contains the knitr/latex source, graphics and R code used in 
book chapter in *Microarray Image and Data Analysis: Theory and Practice* 
published by CRC Press. The authors of this chapter are Simon Cockell, Matthew Bashton, 
and [Colin Gillespie](http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~ncsg3/).

You can download a [pdf](https://github.com/csgillespie/illuminia-analysis/raw/master/Cockell_main.pdf) of the book chapter, or the knitr source code. 

At present, the data set isn't available on ArrayExpress. If you would like a copy of the data set, please email me.
