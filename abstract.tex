\abstract{ Bioconductor (\url{http://bioconductor.org/}) is a freely-available
  set of add-on packages for the R statistical programming language that
  provides comprehensive support for the analysis of high-throughput biological
  data, including microarray data. In this chapter, we will explore the use of
  Bioconductor for the analysis of Affymetrix GeneChip and Illumina BeadArray
  microarrays, including the fundamentals of data import, quality control,
  normalisation and differential gene expression analysis. We will provide
  worked examples of the standard analysis workflows for these data types, as
  well as the downstream analysis of lists of differentially expressed genes and
  clustering of related samples and probes. }
