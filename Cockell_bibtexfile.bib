abstract ={Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes () to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

title = {The sva package for removing batch effects and other unwanted variation in high-throughput experiments},
year = {2012}, 
doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bts034}, 
abstract ={Summary: Heterogeneity and latent variables are now widely recognized as major sources of bias and variability in high-throughput experiments. The most well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effects - when samples are processed on different days, in different groups, or by different people. However, there are also a large number of other variables that may have a major impact on high-throughput measurements. Here we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating, and removing unwanted sources of variation in high-throughput experiments. The sva package supports surrogate variable estimation with the sva function, direct adjustment for known batch effects with the ComBat function, and adjustment for batch and latent variables in prediction problems with the fsva function.Availability: The R package sva is freely available from http://www.bioconductor.org.Contact: jleek@jhsph.edu},

doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btl476}, 
abstract ={Summary: While meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for analyzing microarray experiments by combining data from multiple studies, it presents unique computational challenges. The Bioconductor package RankProd provides a new and intuitive tool for this purpose in detecting differentially expressed genes under two experimental conditions. The package modifies and extends the rank product method proposed by Breitling et al., [(2004)FEBS Lett., 573, 83–92] to integrate multiple microarray studies from different laboratories and/or platforms. It offers several advantages over t-test based methods and accepts pre-processed expression datasets produced from a wide variety of platforms. The significance of the detection is assessed by a non-parametric permutation test, and the associated P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) are included in the output alongside the genes that are detected by user-defined criteria. A visualization plot is provided to view actual expression levels for each gene with estimated significance measurements.Availability: RankProd is available at Bioconductor http://www.bioconductor.org. A web-based interface will soon be available at http://cactus.salk.edu/RankProdContact:fhong@salk.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

doi = {10.1093/nar/gkm1075}, 
abstract ={Variance stabilization is a step in the preprocessing of microarray data that can greatly benefit the performance of subsequent statistical modeling and inference. Due to the often limited number of technical replicates for Affymetrix and cDNA arrays, achieving variance stabilization can be difficult. Although the Illumina microarray platform provides a larger number of technical replicates on each array (usually over 30 randomly distributed beads per probe), these replicates have not been leveraged in the current log2 data transformation process. We devised a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) method that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on an Illumina microarray. We have compared VST with log2 and Variance-stabilizing normalization (VSN) by using the Kruglyak bead-level data (2006) and Barnes titration data (2005). The results of the Kruglyak data suggest that VST stabilizes variances of bead-replicates within an array. The results of the Barnes data show that VST can improve the detection of differentially expressed genes and reduce false-positive identifications. We conclude that although both VST and VSN are built upon the same model of measurement noise, VST stabilizes the variance better and more efficiently for the Illumina platform by leveraging the availability of a larger number of within-array replicates.

abstract ={Summary: Illumina microarray is becoming a popular microarray platform. The BeadArray technology from Illumina makes its preprocessing and quality control different from other microarray technologies. Unfortunately, most other analyses have not taken advantage of the unique properties of the BeadArray system, and have just incorporated preprocessing methods originally designed for Affymetrix microarrays. lumi is a Bioconductor package especially designed to process the Illumina microarray data. It includes data input, quality control, variance stabilization, normalization and gene annotation portions. In specific, the lumi package includes a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) algorithm that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on every Illumina microarray. Different normalization method options and multiple quality control plots are provided in the package. To better annotate the Illumina data, a vendor independent nucleotide universal identifier (nuID) was devised to identify the probes of Illumina microarray. The nuID annotation packages and output of lumi processed results can be easily integrated with other Bioconductor packages to construct a statistical data analysis pipeline for Illumina data.Availability: The lumi Bioconductor package, www.bioconductor.orgContact: dupan@northwestern.edu},
